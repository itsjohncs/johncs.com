Stack Overflow answers for `bash` problems seem way code golfier than other languages. Look at [this function to check if an array contains an element](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8574392/3920202):

```bash
containsElement () {
    local e match="$1"
    shift
    for e; do [[ "$e" == "$match" ]] && return 0; done
    return 1
}
```

I feel like the writer didn't want people to understand this. Here's a commented and split-onto-multiple-lines version:

```bash
containsElement () {
    # Declare e and match as local variables. Initialize match.
    local e match="$1"

    # Shift all positional parameters. $1 gets set to $2, etc...
    shift

    # This is the same as for e in "$@" (who knew in was optional!)
    for e; do
        # If [[ ... ]] return 0
        [[ "$e" == "$match" ]] && return 0
    done
    return 1
}
```

And finally here's the version I actually used:

```bash
function contains_element {
    local i
    for i in "${@:2}"; do
        if [[ $i == "$1" ]]; then
            return 0
        fi
    done

    return 1
}
```
